## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone responsive-startup-website:

# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/mahmoudzanoun13/responsive-startup-website

# Move into the repository
$ cd responsive-startup-website

# Remove the current origin repository

After that, you can install an extension called [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in your code editor.
